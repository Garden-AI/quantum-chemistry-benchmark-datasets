# Collections of Quantum Chemistry Benchmark Datasets

Understanding the limitations of a theory is crucial to knowing how it can be used.
Accordingly, there are many datasets in the quantum chemistry literature which compare different theories against each other and data from experiment.
We collect them and make them available easily via [Foundry](https://foundry-ml.org/#/) in this repository.

## Installation

The environment needed to run these scripts is defined with Anaconda. 
Build it using
