# Diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) Level Energies of QM9 Molecules

**Paper**: [Haung et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06430.pdf)

**Full Dataset**: [Materials Data Facility](https://acdc.alcf.anl.gov/mdf/detail/qmc_ml_v1.1/)

Haung et al. performed thousands of DMC computations for small molecules from the QM9 dataset using different DMC configurations.

## Installation

The data import script requires installing utilities from QMCPack. 
Download the source code and replace the path to `qmca` in the [data preparation notebook](./prepare-foundry-dataset.ipynb)

> *Note*: You do not need to compile QMCPack. qmca is a Python utility provided with the source code.
